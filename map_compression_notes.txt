MAP COMPRESSION - DESIGN NOTES
==============================

Some proposed compression methods:

++++++++
METHOD 1
++++++++
Stick all the tile indices in the map, from the beginning to the end, in a single array, then:
compress using pairs of number in the format:
[tile index, total tiles]
every time the type of tile changes
Here's an example:
Encode the following run of tiles:
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3
as:
1,9,0,6,1,7,3,2

Note: the above method could also be applied to the pixels in individual tiles.


++++++++
METHOD 2
++++++++
Encode rectangular areas of tiles using the (col, row) coordinates of the top left and bottom right corners of the area.

First, find the tile that is most plentiful in the map. Then encode a rectangular area the entire size of the map with that tile.

Rectangular areas will be encoded in the format:
[tile index, top_left_x, top_left_y, bottom_right_x, bottom_right_y]

Secondly, go through the entire map and encode every rectangular area in it in the above format.
